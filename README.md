# Advanced Exploit Simulation Documentation

Advanced Exploit Simulation is a C# console application designed to simulate vulnerabilities in network protocols including FTP, SMTP, and HTTP.
Requirements

.NET Core 3.1 or higher

Installation

Compile the source code using the .NET Core SDK. You can compile the program with the following command:

bash

dotnet build

Usage

Run the application using the command below:

bash

AdvancedExploitSimulation.exe <ftp/smtp/http> <ipAddress> <port>

### Parameters:

  <ftp/smtp/http> - Specifies the protocol for simulation (FTP, SMTP, or HTTP).
  <ipAddress> - IP address of the target server.
  <port> - Port number of the target server.

#### Function Descriptions
FtpExploitAsync

Simulates an FTP server attack using a buffer overflow exploit during the PASS command.
SmtpExploitAsync

Simulates an SMTP server attack using command injection during the mail sending process.
HttpExploitAsync

Simulates an HTTP server attack using SQL injection via GET request parameters.

Step 1: Virtual Organization Setup

  # start simulation
   # Virtual Infrastructure:
  VM1: Attacker’s Machine - Set up with your Advanced Exploit Simulation software, configured to perform FTP, SMTP, and HTTP attacks.
  VM2: Corporate Server - Hosts various services like FTP, SMTP, and HTTP, configured with intentional vulnerabilities. This server also serves as a web application server.
        VM3: Database Server with NAS - Stores sensitive information and connects to VM2 for data transactions.
        VM4: Security Systems - Hosts security tools including a Web Application Firewall (WAF), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system like Splunk, and network monitoring tools.

    Network Configuration:
   Design the network to reflect a typical corporate environment with internal and DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) segments. VM2 and VM3 are in the DMZ, while VM4 is in the internal network segment.

Step 2: Conducting the Attack Simulation

  Launch Phases:
        Use the Advanced Exploit Simulation software on VM1 to initiate attacks based on the selected protocol (FTP, SMTP, HTTP).
        Simulate FTP buffer overflow, SMTP command injection, and HTTP SQL injection attacks on VM2.
        Monitor how the attacks affect VM2 and try to propagate to VM3.

  Data Interaction and Exfiltration:
        Attempt to extract data from VM3 using the vulnerabilities exploited on VM2 to demonstrate lateral movement and data breach scenarios.

Step 3: Defense Mechanisms

  WAF Setup and Configuration:
        Implement a WAF on VM2 to protect against web application attacks. Configure rules specific to the vulnerabilities you’re exploiting (e.g., SQL injection prevention, input sanitization).

  SIEM and SOC Operations:
        Deploy Splunk on VM4 to collect and analyze logs from VM2 and VM3. Set up real-time alerts for attack signatures and unusual network traffic.
        Use this setup to simulate an operational Security Operations Center (SOC) that monitors, detects, and responds to threats.

Step 4: Detection, Response, and Remediation

   Detection:
        Utilize Splunk to detect malicious activities based on the intrusion signatures and anomalous behaviors like unexpected outbound connections or privilege escalations.

  Response:
        Upon detection, implement automated scripts or manual procedures to isolate affected systems, block malicious traffic, and terminate malicious processes.

  Remediation:
        Patch the vulnerabilities in VM2 that were exploited, change credentials, and restore affected systems from backups.
        Adjust WAF configurations and update firewall rules to prevent similar future attacks.

Step 5: Reporting and Evaluation

  Incident Reporting:
        Compile detailed incident reports based on Splunk’s analysis, documenting the attack vectors, timeline, response effectiveness, and areas of improvement.

  Post-Experiment Evaluation:
        Conduct a thorough review to evaluate the defensive mechanisms’ effectiveness.
        Plan and implement improvements to security policies, training, and infrastructure based on the findings from the experiment.
